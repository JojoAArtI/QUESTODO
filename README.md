> "The only to-do list that judges you (lovingly)."

**Task Quest** is a simple, no-nonsense task manager built with **Jetpack Compose** and **Neo-Brutalism** design. It doesn't just store your tasks; it pesters you to actually do them with witty notifications and sassy empty states.

## Features 🚀

-   **Neo-Brutalist UI**: Bold borders, harsh shadows, and zero fluff.
-   **Sassy Notifications**: Reminders that might actually guilt-trip you into productivity.
-   **Humane Code**: Written by humans (mostly) for humans. Comments are actually funny.
-   **Offline First**: Database persistence because the internet is fleeting, but your chores are forever.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

-   **Kotlin** + **Jetpack Compose**
-   **Room Database** (Local Storage)
-   **AlarmManager** (For the pestering)
-   **Hilt** (Dependency Injection - wait, did we use Hilt? No, we kept it simple. Manual DI for the win!)

## How to Download & Run 🏃

Since we are too cool for the Play Store (read: broke), you gotta build it yourself or grab an APK if we posted one.

1.  **Clone it**: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-quest.git`
2.  **Open it**: Fire up **Android Studio** and open the project folder.
3.  **Run it**: Hit that green play button and pray.

*Check the **Releases** tab if you just want the APK (coming soon... maybe).*
